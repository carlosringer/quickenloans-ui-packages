# QuickenLoans-UI-Packages

This is a collection of packages focused on UI elements and features.

Each package, listed in the packages folder, is published individually on
npm. Inside the package folders, each package has its own readme,
package.json, tests, etc.

## Getting started

You can install any individual package by doing:

    npm install <package-name>

See each package's readme for usage instructions.

## Contribution

The packages are organized in a monorepo fashion, so if you want to open
an issue, open it on this repo.

If you'd like to open a PR, fork this repo and open it against master.
